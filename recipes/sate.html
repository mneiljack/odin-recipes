                <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons peanut oil</li>
                <li>4 shallots, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
                <li>2 small red chile peppers, seeded and minced</li>
                <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
                <li>1 ¾ cups coconut milk</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons lime juice</li>
                <li>12 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 1 hour</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss chicken, garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in a bowl until the chicken is coated in the marinade. Cover, and marinate for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>While the chicken is marinating, heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in shallots, garlic, ginger, and chile peppers. Cook and stir until the shallot begins to turn golden brown, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and stir in peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, and lime juice until blended. Simmer very gently for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread chicken onto skewers.</li>
                <li>Grill chicken skewers on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with warm peanut sauce.</li>
            </ol>
